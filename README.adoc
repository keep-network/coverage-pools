A governable, fee-earning asset pool to cover low-likelihood on-chain events.

toc::[]

== What is it?

A coverage pool is a flexible new money lego that can be used as a back-stop or
"buyer of last resort" in on-chain financial systems.

Across DeFi, young systems are hiding and shuffling around risk for perceived
security. These risks are part of what drive yield; but stacked atop eachother,
risks are multiplied.

Coverage pools can be used in these systems to offset risk, allowing human or
algorithmic governance to reward underwriters. They're designed as building
blocks rather than a standalone product, allowing system designers and
communities to tailor risk management to their circumstances.

== Goals

1. Pool assets to back risk denominated in a particular asset.
2. Manage those assets without unnecessary reliance on oracles.
3. Allow underwriters to choose the asset exposure that best fits their
   portfolio, increasing capital participation.
4. Share risks and rewards across all underwriters, subject to their asset
   exposure.

The first iteration of the design focuses on backing a single system authority
than can file and approve its own claims against the pool, in the asset the
pool is configured to support. Governance and underwriters are expected to
review and judge the risk of that system authority, as it has the power to
liquidate the pool.

Future iterations could introduce explicit synthetic asset minting for claim
management, though that functionality should be easy to build atop the initial
design.

== Questions

> Doesn't this already exist?

Probably. The ideas behind coverage pools have been picked from a number of
DeFi and TradFi systems. The sum of the parts— choose-your-own-asset pools with
socialized rewards and losses, without outside oracles — is what's interesting
as a building block.

> Why shouldn't I just use Nexus Mutual, Opyn, or another risk management
> solution?

You should! Coverage pools are a component for new on-chain financial systems,
not a replacement for end user applications. If you need to cover a particular
risk of yours, there are a variety of centralized and decentralized options on
the market. If you need to cover risk in a new system... maybe because you're
building a synthetic asset exchange, or a lending platform — coverage pools
might be for you.

== Build, test and deploy

Coverage pool contracts use https://hardhat.org/[*Hardhat*] development
environment. To build and deploy these contracts, please follow the instructions
presented below.

=== Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- https://nodejs.org[Node.js] >12.22.1
- https://yarnpkg.com[Yarn] >1.22.10

=== Build contracts

To build the smart contracts, install node packages first:
```
yarn install
```
Once packages are installed, you can build the smart contracts using:
```
yarn build
```
Compiled contracts will land in the `build/` directory.

*NOTE:* The `coverage-pools` package contains an indirect dependency to
`@summa-tx/relay-sol@2.0.2` package, which downloads one of its sub-dependencies
via unathenticated `git://` protocol. That protocol is no longer supported by
GitHub. This means that in certain situations installation of the package or
update of its dependencies using Yarn may result in `The unauthenticated git
protocol on port 9418 is no longer supported` or `unable to connect to
github.com` error. +
As a workaround, we advise changing Git configuration to use `https://` protocol
instead of `git://` by executing:
```
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
```

=== Test contracts

There are multiple test scenarios living in the `test` directory.
You can run them by doing:
```
yarn test
```

=== Deploy contracts

To deploy all contracts on the given network, please run:
```
yarn deploy --network <network>
```

If contracts haven't been built yet or changes occurred, this task will build
the contracts before running the deployment script.

==== Deployment artifacts

Once the deployment terminates, a new `deployments` directory containing all
deployment info will be created. It can be directly used by dApps or other client
code as it contains deployment details like chain ID, transaction hash, ABI or
address for each contract.

The `deployments/` directory contains a separate sub-directory for each network, e.g.
`deployments/ropsten/`, `deployments/mainnet/`. For a convenient usage of the
package we publish the deployment artifacts in a separate package for every
network. The package contains deployment artifacts under `artifacts/` directory,
which is a a copy of `deployments/<network>/` directory.

===== Export mode

Apart from deployments saved in the `deployments/` folder the details will be also
stored in a lightweight file `export.json`, which contains a handy summary of the
deployment info for all contracts in one place. However, it doesn't contain the
deployment transaction hash making it inappropriate for some use cases relying on
this field.

Please note that it is also possible to export deployment details for all supported
networks into a single file using `--export-all` option. This can be useful for
dApps supporting multiple networks at once.

For more details see `hardhat-deploy` plugin https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy#exporting-deployments[documentation].

==== Published package structure

Deployed contracts are packaged and published to the NPM registry. 

Separate packages for every network are created according to the rules described in
https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/blob/main/docs/rfc/rfc-18-release-management.adoc[RFC-18].

A package follows a directory structure described in the <<package-structure-table, table>>.

.Published package structure
[[package-structure-table]]
[%autowidth,cols="1,3"]
|===
|Path|Description

|`artifacts/`
|Deployment artifacts for the given network, see <<Deployment artifacts>>

|`build/contracts/`
|Compiled contracts artifacts, see <<Build contracts>>

|`contracts/`
|Contracts source code

|`export.json`
|Single-file deployment export, see <<Export mode>>

==== Deployment parametrization

The deployment scripts parametrization is handled by environment variables.

Following parameters are supported:

[cols="1,2,1"]

|Variable|Description|Default

|`INITIAL_SWAP_STRATEGY`
|Initial swap strategy which will be used by the risk manager.
This should be the name of one of the `ISignerBondsSwapStrategy` implementations.
|`SignerBondsManualSwap`
|===

==== External dependencies

Deployment scripts require external contract dependencies. The scripts support
dependencies as <<dependencies-packages,node packages pulled from the NPM registry>>
or <<dependencies-predefined,predefined addresses>> stored in `external/<network>/` directory.

For more details see `hardhat-deploy` plugin https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy#importing-deployment-from-other-projects-with-truffle-support[documentation].

[[dependencies-packages]]
===== Node packages

To add an external package dependency: 

1. Add a package dependency with `yarn add <package>`.
+
Example:
+
```sh
yarn add @keep-network/keep-core@1.8.0-dev
```

2. Add an entry in `hardhat.config.ts` under `external` property.
+
Example:
+
```js
  external: {
    contracts: [
      // ...
      {
        artifacts: "node_modules/@keep-network/keep-core/artifacts",
      }
    ],
    deployments: {
      // ...
      ropsten: [
         // ...
        "node_modules/@keep-network/keep-core/artifacts",
      ],
    },
  },
```

This solution support both Hardhat and Truffle artifacts.

[[dependencies-predefined]]
===== Predefined artifacts

To add a predefined single contract dependency for a given network:

1. Create a file under `external/<network>/<contract_name>.json`.
+
Example: `external/ropsten/UniswapV2Router.json`

2. Save an address and optionally an ABI for the contract in the file.
+
Example:
+
```json
{
  "address": "0xZZabcd0000000000000000000000000000000001",
  "abi": [
     // ...
  ]
}
```

3. Make sure the directory path is listed in `hardhat.config.ts` under
`external.deployments.<network>` property.
+
Example:
+
```js
  external: {
    deployments: {
      // ...
      ropsten: [
         // ...
        "./external/ropsten",
      ],
    },
  },
```

===== Usage in scripts

External artifacts can be used in scripts with `deployments.get` or `deployments.getOrNull`
functions.

Example:
```js
const KeepToken = await deployments.get("KeepToken")
deployments.log(`using external KeepToken at ${KeepToken.address}`)
```

==== Deployment scripts structure and tags

The deployment script is divided into multiple sub-scripts placed in the
`deploy` directory. It uses the
https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy#deploy-scripts-tags-and-dependencies[tags and dependencies]
system provided by the `hardhat-deploy` plugin. Such a structure allows to
run arbitrary parts of the entire deployment by using the tag mechanism. For
example, to deploy only the `AssetPool` contract (with their dependencies),
a following command can be used:
```
yarn deploy --network localhost --tags AssetPool
```
Multiple deployment sub-scripts also improves the readability and allows
specifying dependencies between components in an explicit way.
