      # This step forces Git to download dependencies using `https://` protocol,
      # even if `yarn.json` refers to some package via `git://`. Using `git://`
      # is no longer supported by GH. One of the `coverage-pools` dependencies
      # by default uses `git://` and we needed to manually remove it every time
      # it re-appeares in the lock file. Now even if it does re-appear, the
      # `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` will not fail.
