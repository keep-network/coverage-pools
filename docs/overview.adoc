== The collateral pool

The collateral pool is a collection of single asset pools that share losses
if coverage is required.

Each asset pool accepts a single ERC-20 token as collateral, and returns an
underwriter token. For example, an asset pool might accept deposits in WETH in
return for covETH underwriter tokens. Underwriter tokens represent an ownership
share in the underlying collateral of the asset pool.

Entering the collateral pool exposes an underwriter to the shared risk of
liquidation across all asset pools, but it *doesn't* require the underwriter to
enter into any positions relative to other assets in the pool. If an underwriter
deposits ETH into a collateral pool that with ETH adn WBTC asset pools, the
underwriter isn't entering into a position relative to WBTC, or suffering any
sort of impermanent loss, as they would in an automated market maker.

Underwriters are still, however, entering into positions relative to the asset
the coverage pool is backing.

== <<risk-manager.adoc,The risk manager>>

The risk manager is a person or smart contract with the exclusive right to
demand coverage from the pool.

Demanding coverage is akin to filing a claim in traditional insurance... and
processing your own claim. The risk manager holds an incredibly privileged
position, because the ability to demand coverage of an arbitrarily large
position could bankrupt the collateral pool.

Coverage is always paid out in the pool's covered asset.

== <<rewards-pool.adoc,The rewards pool>>

The rewards pool is a collection of different assets
that grows as underwriters earn fees and refunds.

The rewards pool mints a single rewards token, which is periodically
distributed across the collateral pool. Each asset pool in the collateral pool
earns based on its rewards rate.

Over a period of a week, if a collateral pool contains two asset pools — WBTC at
a rewards rate of 2, and ETH at an rewards rate of 1 — each will be allocated
rewards pool tokens at a rate of 2 to 1.

As rewards accrue, rewards pool tokens can be withdrawn by underwriters and
redeemed for the underlying rewards.

= Efficient collateral liquidation

When coverage is demanded by the risk manager, some part of the collateral
pool must be sold to obtain enough of the covered asset to fulfill the claim.

Liquidating the coverage pool fairly means selling a basket of assets, in a
fixed ratio, with good price discovery. For this reason, collateral is
liquidated using a Dutch auction.

The portion of each asset pool on offer will increase over time, slowing until
the entirety of the pool is on offer.

The auction is meant to be flash-loan friendly, allowing easy integration with
AMMs (automated market makers) and other on-chain liquidity sources.

Once the entirety of the pool is on offer, the auction will remain open until a
buyer is found.

If the risk manager has made a fill-or-kill claim, the auction will expire and
notify the risk manager. If not, all funds will remain locked on offer.

= Governance and the market feedback loop

= Solving early exits

Underwriters will always be able to front-run on-chain claims against the
coverage pool.  Rational players can withdraw their liquidity and rewards
before a covered event, earning any fees and rewards while avoiding the risks
a pool covers.

Locking underwriter positions during a liquidation won't help, since many claims
are foreseeable outside the system long before a risk manager makes the call to
demand coverage.

Another common approach to solve early exits involves locking underwriters for
a fixed period when they deposit. Choosing the right fixed period is an art,
and can devolve into cyclical deposit/withdraw games to minimize risk, as well
as increased risk of merchanism failure at transitions.

Instead of a fixed delay, we introduce exit markets.

== <<exit-markets.adoc,Exit markets>>

At a given moment, whether or not a liquidation is ongoing, a mass exit from
the collateral pool implies a pending spike in risk.

When an underwriter wants to exit immediately, we expect that they'd be happy to
pay a premium to exit quickly and reduce their risk. To turn this incentive into
a market, we can attach withdrawal fees to a bonding curve, discovering the
price of impending risk and a potential liquidation.

All withdrawals from a single-asset pool that accept a fixed delay can do so
without a fee. Any underwriter who wants to withdraw more quickly will forfeit
part of their collateral to the pool, with a fee rate based on their percent
ownership of the pool.

As an extreme example, an underwriter with 100% of a pool's shares would pay
100% of their collateral to the pool to withdraw immediately.

This mechanism and parameters well-chosen to a pool's covered risk should
incentivize a smooth market, and rewards longer-term underwriters while still
encouraging short-term market risk information to spread.
