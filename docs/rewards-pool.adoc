= The rewards pool

A rewards pool is a contract that accepts arbitrary assets and mints a single
reward token. Recipients of the reward token can at any time turn it in for a
portion of the rewards in the pool.

A rewards pool maintains a governable list of recipients and relative reward
rates. For example, a rewards pool might have two recipients — a WETH
asset pool, and a WBTC asset pool, with respective reward rates of 1 and 2.

Rewards tokens are minted constantly over time and distributed according to the
relative reward rates.

== Accounting for rewards distribution

Given the above scenario, at rewards pool creation. 3 rewards tokens are minted.
1 is reserved for the WETH asset pool, and 2 for the WBTC asset pool.

Every tick, an additional 3 rewards tokens are virtually minted.

|4    |4                     |8

At tick 5, if the rewards rates are changed, say to 1:1, the rewards tokens are
realized, then the virtual minting continues at the new rate.

Similarly, any rewards tokens that are exchanged and burned for the underlying
pool rewards realizes all reward token minting before the exchange occurs.

This structure should make it clear that reward pools scale in the number of
ongoing reward recipients — with implications for the <<on-chain-efficiency,
number of assets>> supported as collateral in a coverage pool.

== Relation to collateral pools

A coverage pool has a single rewards pool that receives and manages all
underwriter earnings. Each asset pool in the collateral pool is assigned a
relative rate in the rewards pool, establishing a way for governance to
incentivize different assets to target a particular collateral pool composition.

If an asset that's accepted as collateral by the coverage pool is intended as
underwriter rewards, it should first be deposited in its asset pool, and the
underwriter token sent to the rewards pool. Following this pattern means a more
capital-efficient coverage rewards mechanism, though it also means rewards are
subject to exit markets.

For example, in a coverage pool meant to back claims denominated in `TBTC`, with
a collateral pool containing `WETH` and `WBTC`, any `ETH` earned by the
underwriters should be deposited into the reward pool as `covETH` rather than
`WETH`.

== On-chain efficiency

There are two bottlenecks in efficient runtime on the EVM with this structure.

The first is the number of reward recipients. Each rate change and reward token
burn require iterating through all recipients, computing rewards, and minting
tokens. These costs are ultimately shouldered by reward beneficiaries, and place
a ceiling on the number of simultaneous reward recipients.

The second is the number of different assets being distributed as reward. Anyone
can send a reward pool whatever tokens they'd like. Instead of using an allowlist
or pushing the cost onto reward token holders at redemption time, a short
denylist can be used to avoid mischief, and reward token holders can decide
which tokens they'd like to be sent at redemption.
